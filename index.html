Description: 
We will explore how historical data becomes historical evidence and how recent technological advances affect long-established practices, such as close attention to historical context and contingency. Will the advent of fast computing and big data make history “count” more or lead to unprecedented insights into the study of change over time? During our weekly discussions, we will apply what we learn in lectures and labs to the analysis of selected historical sources and get an understanding of constructing historical datasets. We will also consider scholarly debates over quantitative evidence and historical argument.


The main Foundations of Data Science course provides a baseline of computing skills, statistical concepts, and data visualization. This connector applies and reinforces inferential and computing ideas from the main course in relation to relevant historical materials, and it introduces students to key debates about the usefulness and limits of such approaches that can be found in many different areas of the study of history.

Concretely, the course addresses how workable historical data are constructed out of incomplete, selective, and messy primary materials, such as archival collections, textual materials, or administrative records. It goes into greater depth on questions related to the marshaling of evidence as touched on in the main course, which can include the use of distributions, sampling, regression, time series data, causation, networks, mapping, and visualization. It opens up methodological questions of quantitative and other approaches to historical argument, helping students understand the options presented by the main course in the context of the overall character of historical thinking.

Topics include :

What counts as quantitative history, and what doesn’t?
Debate 1: Narrative and quantification
Organizing historical data: turning raw data into a database
Debate 2: Sampling and its significance: Time on the Cross, and the critics and supporters of cliometrics
Visualizing income inequality over time: why are we so confident about the Piketty-Saez “U-shaped” curve?
Recap 1: The many uses of descriptive statistics in historical contexts
Extensions 1: Indices, growth rates and other tools by historians
The promise, and peril, of moving beyond descriptive statistics: thinking historically about explaining variance
Extension 2: Thinking about non-linear relationships: a richer explanation and more realistic explanation of variance in the real-world?
Debate 3: History in the era of Big Data: a repeat of the cliometrics debate?
Recap 2: How many uses of quantitative approaches in historical contexts?

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">using GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new <code>gh-pages</code> branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating pages manually</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
