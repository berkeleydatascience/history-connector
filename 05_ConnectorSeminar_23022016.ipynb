    "There are several different ways to assess what values data tend to center around. In class, we saw two such measures of the central tendency, the mean and the median, and another two are sometimes used, the mode and the midrange (the latter is defined briefly below, but not part of the examples). \n",
    "\n",
    "The [mean], frequently referred to as by x-bar, and the median, referred to as x-tilde, are defined in the textbook. Briefly, the mean is the arithmetic average (sum all the scores and divide them by the total number of scores), and the [median] is the “half-way point” (rank all the scores, and if there are an odd number of scores, the middle one is the half-way point, and if there are an even number of scores, the half-way point is the mean of the middle two numbers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Two other measures of the central tendency to keep in mind include the mode and the midrange. The [mode], frequently referred to as M, is simply the most frequent score. Is it possible to have a set of scores without a mode, or with several? If no score is repeated, then there is no mode – by contrast, the mean and the median always exist; if two different scores are repeated the same, greatest frequency, then the data set is described as bimodal (and, yes, when more than two scores appear with the same greatest frequency, then the data set is multimodal). Finally, the [midrange], the least commonly used measure of the central tendency is the average of the highest and lowest score in the data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why so many measures? Each one has a use, for instance the midrange is sensitive to extreme values, and it can complement the median as a measure when the data set has extreme, or outlier scores. The mode is useful for nominal (“name only”) type data – in this election season, it is useful to note the mode of survey response answers yes, no, and undecided, and we saw that it was useful to note the slight gender disbalance in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the lab, we will look at the central tendency, and we will focus on age of the principle slave on the record and of the first child, V16 and V20, respectively. In the second part of the lab, we will look at a measure of variation of scores around the mean, the standard deviation. Specifically, we will calculate and compare the standard deviation of the ages, as these are captured by V16 and V20, and discuss the results. In the final part, you will be asked to look at different variable, and calculate the central tendency and the standard deviation. The purpose of these exercises is to be able to calculate the so-called [[standard units]], the z-score, the topic to which we turn to next. "

Intuitively, scores that are relatively close together have low measures of variation, whereas scores that are spread further apart have a larger measure of variation.
